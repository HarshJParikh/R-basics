# R-basics

The above files consists of the coding exercises that I did in my Predictive Analytics practicals. If you have a basic understanding of R programming, then you can easily understand the code that i have written. It is recommended for beginners to start with the Basics_of_R.R file so you get an idea about how to code in the R studio platform.
